Use "Query Builder" tab to build both simple as well as complex queries. Queries which are built using "Query Builder" display all the results, note though that these might be paged.

Start typing the attribute value in the "Value" field. The default attribute value is "Any" which means you do not have to know the Attribute upfront. The autocomplete function will suggest attribute-value pairs. Select one of them.

The search results are always images. You can include the study names in your search by adding the "AND" clause to your search query and select  "Name (IDR number)" from the "Attribute" field. Then write the study name into the "Value" field.

Use the "Attribute Browser" tab to explore the Attributes and get help in building your queries. You can either double-click on the desired attribute node in the tree on the left-hand side. This will show a summary results table for that Attribute. The table contains rows (buckets) which each contain the attribute, value and the number of items. To explore the values inside the bucket, double click the relvant row. It will add the attribute and value (using the "AND" operator) to the current clause in the "Query Builder" tab.

Use the "search for any value" field to search for a value whose attribute is not known. The search results are limited to 9999, paging will be added later to allow pulling all the results. The results appear as a summary results table containing rows (buckets) which each contain the attribute, value and the number of items. To explore the values inside the bucket, double click the relvant row. It will add the attribute and value (using the "AND" operator) to the current clause in the "Query Builder" tab.

Use the "Show all attributes" checkbox to search through all attributes. By default, the checkbox is unchecked. This means that the search is taking into account only the "Common attributes", which are the ones with the highest level of curation and usage.
